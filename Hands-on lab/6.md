# Exercise 6: Using serverless Azure Functions to process orders
 
### Estimated Duration: 30 minutes 
 
With its migration to Azure, Parts Unlimited plans to launch a series of campaigns to increase its sales. Their current architecture is processing purchase orders synchronously and is coupled with their front end. Parts Unlimited is looking for ways to decouple its order processing system and make sure it can scale independently from the web front end when orders increase.  

You suggest a serverless approach that can handle order processing and the creation of invoices for processed orders. In this exercise, you will deploy a serverless Azure Function that will listen to an Azure Storage Queue and process orders as they come. Parts Unlimited has already implemented the changes required to push the jobs into a queue of your choice.
 
### Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
   - Task 1: Deploying Azure Functions
   - Task 2: Connecting Function App and App Service
   - Task 3: Testing serverless order processing
   - Task 4: Enable Application Insights on the Function App

### Task 3: Testing serverless order processing

In this task, we will submit a new order on the Parts Unlimited website and observe the order's processing on the order details page. Once the order is submitted, the web front-end will put a job into an Azure Storage Queue. The Function App that we previously deployed is set to listen to the queue and pull jobs for processing. Once order processing is done, a PDF file will be created, and the link for the PDF file will be accessible on the order details page.

1. Go back to the resource list and navigate to your **partsunlimited-web-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**
App Service resource. You can search for **`partsunlimited-web` (1)** to find your Web App and App Service Plan.

   ![The search box for the resource is filled in with partsunlimited-web. The partsunlimited-web-20 Azure App Service is highlighted in the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/6.3.1.png "Resources")

2. In the **Overview (1)** section, select **Default domain (2)** and navigate to the Parts Unlimited web site hosted in Azure App Service.

    ![Parts Unlimited App Service is on screen. URL is highlighted.](media/appmod-ex4-t6-s8.png "App Service Public Endpoint")

3. Select **Login (1)**. If a login wasn't created in the earlier exercise, then select **Register as a new user? (2)**, otherwise skip to step 6 (login to the web site)

    ![Parts Unlimited web site login screen is presented. Log in and Register as a new user buttons are highlighted.](media/Register1.png "Parts Unlimited Login")

4. Type in `test@test.com` for the email **(1)** and `Password.1!!` **(2)** for the password. Select **Register (3)**.

    ![Parts Unlimited web site user registration screen is presented. Email box is filled with test@test.com. Password boxes are filled in with Password.1!!. The register button is highlighted.](media/Register2.png "Register")

### Task 4: Enable Application Insights on the Function App

In this task, you add Application Insights to your Function App in the Azure Portal, to be able to collect insights related to Function executions.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **Function App** by selecting the **hands-on-lab-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
resource group, and selecting the **parts-func-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** Function App from the list of resources.

   - Select **Create new resource (1)**, and accept the default resource name and location provided. 
   - Select existing log analytics workspace **parts-Workspace-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>(2)** workspace from the dropdown as shown in the below screenshot.
   - Click on **Apply (3)**, and select **Yes** when prompted about restarting the Function App to apply monitoring settings.

   ![The Create New Application Insights blade is displayed with a unique name set under Create new resource. Apply and the following Yes approval buttons are highlighted.](media/monitoring.png "Add Application Insights")

4. After the Function App restarts, select **View Application Insights data**.

   ![The View Application Insights data link is highlighted.](media/App-Mod-app-insights.png "View Application Insights data")

5. On the Application Insights blade, select **Live Metrics (1)** under **Investigate**.

   ![Live Metrics Stream is highlighted in the left-hand menu on the Application Insights blade.](media/updated112.png "Application Insights")

   > It might take a few minutes for the Live Metrics to get loaded. Refresh the Page to view the Live Metrics.
    
   > While monitoring Live Metrics, try submitting a new order on the Parts Unlimited website. You will see access to blob storage in the telemetry to upload the **PDF (3)**, the execution count on the **graph (2)**, and **server details (4)**.

> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
	
  - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.
