# Exercise 3: Migrate the On-prem Database to Azure and configure it with your App service

Duration: 80 minutes

The next step of Part Unlimited's migration project is the assessment and migration of its database. Currently, the database lives on SQL Server 2008 R2 on a virtual machine. You will use an **Azure Migrate: Database Assessment** tool called **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** to assess the `PartsUnlimited` database for migration to Azure SQL Database. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and Azure SQL Database. After the assessment, you will use an **Azure Migrate: Database Migration** service called **Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)**. During the exercise, you will use a simulated on-premises environment hosted on virtual machines running on Azure.
## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Connect to your SqlServer2008 VM with RDP

- Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

- Task 3: Retrieve connection information for SQL Databases (Optional)

- Task 4: Migrate the database schema using the Data Migration Assistant

- Task 5: Migrate the database using the Azure Database Migration Service 

## Task 1: Connect to your SqlServer2008 VM with RDP

1. From your lab environment (**WebVM**), in the search bar, **Search (1)** for **RDP (2)** and **select** the **Remote Desktop Connection (3)** app.
   
   ![](media/RDP-new.png)

2. Paste the **SQLVM DNS Name (1)** in the **Computer** field and click on **Connect (2)**.
   * **SQLVM DNS Name**: **<inject key="SQLVM DNS Name" style="color:blue" />**

   ![](media/m-17.png)  
 
3. Now, enter the SQLVM **Username (1)**, and **password (2)** provided below and then click on the **OK* (3)* button. Please add the **dot** and **back-slash** `.\` before the username.
   * **username**: **<inject key="SQLVM Username" style="color:blue" />** 
   * **password**: **<inject key="SQLVM Password" style="color:blue" />**
   
   ![](media/m67.png) 

4. Next, click on the **Yes** button to accept the certificate and add in trusted certificates.

## Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

Parts Unlimited would like an assessment to see what potential issues they might need to address in moving their database to Azure SQL Database. In this task, you will use the [Microsoft Data Migration Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=sql-server-2017) (DMA) to assess the `PartsUnlimited` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). Data Migration Assistant (DMA) enables you to upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality on your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. It recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment. The assessment generates a report detailing any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

> **Note**: The Database Migration Assistant is already installed on your Lab (Web) VM. If not found, it can be downloaded through Azure Migrate or from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090807) as well, and as Data Migration Assistant is dependent on .NET Framework 4.8 download and install .Net Framework from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2085155) and **restart** the VM before you install Data Migration Assistant.

1. Launch DMA from the Windows. click on  **Start** menu.

   ![Start menu.](media/m34.png "start")
  
1. Start typing **"data migration" (1)** into the search bar, and then selecting **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (2)** from the search results.

    > **Note**: There is a known issue with screen resolution when using an RDP connection to Windows Server 2008 R2, which may affect some users. This issue presents itself as very small, hard to read text on the screen. The workaround for this is to use a second monitor for the RDP display, which should allow you to scale up the resolution to make the text larger.

   ![](media/updated37u.png)

1. In the DMA dialog, select **+** from the left-hand menu to create a new project.

   ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](media/updated38.png "New DMA project")

1. Take a moment to review the assessment for migrating to Azure SQL DB. The SQL Server feature parity report shows that Analysis Services and SQL Server Reporting Services are unsupported, but these do not affect any objects in the `PartsUnlimited` database, so we won't block a migration. If there is no SQL Server feature parity, then proceed to the next step.

    ![The feature parity report is displayed, and the two unsupported features are highlighted.](media/app-mod-new.png "Feature parity")

### Task 5: Migrate the database using the Azure Database Migration Service 

At this point, you have migrated the database schema using DMA. In this task, you migrate the data from the `PartsUnlimited` database into the new Azure SQL Database using the Azure Database Migration Service.

> The [Azure Database Migration Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dms/dms-overview) integrates some of the functionality of Microsoft's existing tools and services to provide customers with a comprehensive, highly available database migration solution. The service uses the Data Migration Assistant to generate assessment reports that provide recommendations to guide you through the changes required prior to performing a migration. When you're ready to begin the migration process, Azure Database Migration Service performs all of the required steps.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your Azure Database Migration Service by select the **hands-on-lab-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group, and then selecting the **parts-dms-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** Azure Database Migration Service from the list of resources.
