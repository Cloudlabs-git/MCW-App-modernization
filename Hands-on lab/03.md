# Exercise 3: Migrate your application with App Service Migration Assistant
 
### Estimated Duration: 20 minutes

## Overview

App Service Migration Assistant is a tool designed to assess and migrate web applications to Azure App Service. You will explore how the tool identifies compatibility issues, provides remediation recommendations, and facilitates the migration of the web application to Azureâ€™s platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environment.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Migrate the web application to Azure App Service

## Task 1: Migrate the web application to Azure App Service

In this task, after reviewing the assessment results, you have ensured the web application is a good candidate for migration to Azure App Service. Now, we will continue migrating the application.

1. In order to continue with the migration of our website, Azure App Service Migration Assistant needs access to our Azure Subscription. Select **Copy Code & Open Browser** button to be redirected to the Azure Portal.

   ![Azure App Service Migration Assistant's Azure Login dialog is open. A device code is presented. Copy Code & Open Browser button is highlighted.](media/updated31.png "Azure Login")

2. A new tab opens to the login page within the Edge browser. Right-click the text box and select **Paste (1)** to paste your login code. Select **Next (2)** to give subscription access to App Service Migration Assistant.

    ![Azure Code Login web site is open. Context menu for the code textbox is shown. Paste command from the context menu is highlighted. The next button is highlighted as a second step. ](media/updated32.png "Enter Authentication Code")

3. Continue the login process with your Azure Subscription credentials. When you see the message that says **You have signed in to the Azure App Service Migration Assistant application on your device**, close the browser tab and minimize the Edge browser window to return to the App Service Migration Assistant Window.

    ![Azure Login process is complete. A message dialog is shown that indicates the login process is a success.](media/updated33.png "App Service Migration Assistant authentication approval")

4. Select the Azure Migrate project we created **(1)** in the previous exercise to submit the results of our migration. Select **Next (2)** to continue.

5. In order to migrate the Parts Unlimited website, we have to create an App Service Plan. The Azure App Service Migration Assistant will take care of all the requirements needed. Select **Use existing (1)** and select the resource group **hands-on-lab-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** **(2)** as your deployment target. App Service requires a globally unique Site Name, enter **partsunlimited-web-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** **(3)** for **Destination Site Name**. Select the **<inject key="location" style="color:red" />** **(4)** region. Click **Migrate** **(5)** to start the migration process.

    ![Deployment options are presented. Existing lab resource group is selected as destination. Destination site name is set to partsunlimited-web-20X21. Migrate button is highlighted.](media/appservicemigration-migratev2.png "Azure App Service Migration Assistant Options")

    > **WARNING:** If your migration fails with a **WindowsWorkersNotAllowedInLinuxResourceGroup (1)** It may be due to the incorrect region. Try the migration process again, but this time select the correct region.

6. We have just completed the migration of the Parts Unlimited website from IIS into a Virtual Machine to Azure App Service. Congratulations. Let's go back to the Azure Portal and look into Azure Migrate. Search for `migrate` **(1)** on the Azure Portal and select **Azure Migrate (2)**.

    ![Azure Portal is open. The search box is filled with the migrate keyword. Azure Migrate is highlighted from the result list.](media/im1.png "Azure Migrate on Azure Portal Search")

7. Switch to the **Web apps (1)** section. See the number of discovered web servers, assessed websites **(2)** and migrated websites change **(3)**. Keep in mind that you might need to wait for 5 to 10 minutes for the results to show up. You can use the **Refresh** button on the page to see the latest status.

8. Now navigate back to App Service resource and select **partsunlimited-web-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
