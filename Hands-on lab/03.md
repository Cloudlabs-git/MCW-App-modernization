# Exercise 4: Migrate your application with App Service Migration Assistant
 
### Estimated Duration: 20 minutes

## Overview

App Service Migration Assistant is a tool designed to assess and migrate web applications to Azure App Service. You will explore how the tool identifies compatibility issues, provides remediation recommendations, and facilitates the migration of the web application to Azureâ€™s platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environment.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Migrate the web application to Azure App Service

## Task 1: Migrate the web application to Azure App Service

In this task, after reviewing the assessment results, you have ensured the web application is a good candidate for migration to Azure App Service. Now, we will continue migrating the application.

1. Navigate to the **App Service Migration Assistant** window from the background and proceed with **Exercise 3**, migrating your application using the App Service Migration Assistant.

1. In order to continue with the migration of our website, Azure App Service Migration Assistant needs access to our Azure Subscription. Select **Copy Code & Open Browser** button to be redirected to the Azure Portal.

   ![Azure App Service Migration Assistant's Azure Login dialog is open. A device code is presented. Copy Code & Open Browser button is highlighted.](media/updated31.png "Azure Login")

2. A new tab opens to the login page within the Edge browser. Right-click the text box and select **Paste (1)** to paste your login code. Select **Next (2)** to give subscription access to App Service Migration Assistant.

    ![Azure Code Login web site is open. Context menu for the code textbox is shown. Paste command from the context menu is highlighted. The next button is highlighted as a second step. ](media/updated32.png "Enter Authentication Code")

3. Continue the login process with your Azure Subscription credentials. When you see the message that says **You have signed in to the Azure App Service Migration Assistant application on your device**, close the browser tab and minimize the Edge browser window to return to the App Service Migration Assistant Window.

    ![Azure Login process is complete. A message dialog is shown that indicates the login process is a success.](media/updated33.png "App Service Migration Assistant authentication approval")

4. Select the Azure Migrate project we created **(1)** in the previous exercise to submit the results of our migration. Select **Next (2)** to continue.

    ![Azure Migrate Project is set to partsunlimitedweb. The next button is highlighted.](media/updated34.png "Azure Migrate Hub integration")

5. In order to migrate the Parts Unlimited website, we have to create an App Service Plan. The Azure App Service Migration Assistant will take care of all the requirements needed. Select **Use existing (1)** and select the resource group **hands-on-lab-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** **(2)** as your deployment target. App Service requires a globally unique Site Name, enter **partsunlimited-web-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** **(3)** for **Destination Site Name**. Select the **<inject key="location" style="color:red" />** **(4)** region. Click **Migrate** **(5)** to start the migration process.

    ![Deployment options are presented. Existing lab resource group is selected as destination. Destination site name is set to partsunlimited-web-20X21. Migrate button is highlighted.](media/appservicemigration-migratev2.png "Azure App Service Migration Assistant Options")

    > **WARNING:** If your migration fails with a **WindowsWorkersNotAllowedInLinuxResourceGroup (1)** It may be due to the incorrect region. Try the migration process again, but this time select the correct region.  
    >
    > ![Migration failed error screen is shown. WindowsWorkersNotAllowedInLinuxResourceGroup message is highlighted.](media/updated35.png "Migration failed")

6. We have just completed the migration of the Parts Unlimited website from IIS into a Virtual Machine to Azure App Service. Congratulations. Let's go back to the Azure Portal and look into Azure Migrate. Search for `migrate` **(1)** on the Azure Portal and select **Azure Migrate (2)**.

    ![Azure Portal is open. The search box is filled with the migrate keyword. Azure Migrate is highlighted from the result list.](media/im1.png "Azure Migrate on Azure Portal Search")

7. Switch to the **Web apps (1)** section. See the number of discovered web servers, assessed websites **(2)** and migrated websites change **(3)**. Keep in mind that you might need to wait for 5 to 10 minutes for the results to show up. You can use the **Refresh** button on the page to see the latest status.

## Task 2: Configure the application connection to SQL Azure Database

Now that we have both our application and database migrated to Azure. It is time to configure our application to use the SQL Azure Database.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your `parts` SQL Database resource by selecting the **hands-on-lab-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group, and selecting the `parts` SQL Database from the list of resources.

   ![The parts SQL database resource is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/updated64.png "SQL database")

2. Switch to the **Connection strings (1)** Blade, and copy the connection string under **ADO.NET(SQL authentication)** by selecting the copy button **(2)**.

   ![Connection string panel if SQL Database is open. Copy button for ADO.NET connection string is highlighted.](media/appmod-ex4-t6-s2.png "Database connection string")

3. Paste the value into a text editor, such as Notepad.exe, to replace the Password placeholder. Replace the `{your_password}` section with **<inject key="SQLVM Password" />**. Copy the full connection string with the replaced password for later use.

    ![Notepad is open. SQL Connection string is pasted in. {your_password} placeholder is highlighted.](media/sql-connection-string-password-replace.png "Database connection string")

4. Go back to the resource list, navigate to your partsunlimited-web-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> **(2)** App Service resource. You can search for `partsunlimited-web` **(1)** to find your Web App and App Service Plan.

   ![The search box for resources is filled in with partsunlimited-web. The partsunlimited-web-20 Azure App Service is highlighted in the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.](media/updated66.png "Resources")

5. Switch to the **Environment variables (1)** Blade, and select **connection string (2)** then click on **+Add (3)**.

6. On the **Add/Edit connection string** panel, enter the following:

   - **Name (1)**: Enter `DefaultConnectionString`
   - **Value (2)**: Enter SQL Connection String you copied in Step 3.
   - **Type (3)**: Select **SQLAzure**
   - **Deployment slot setting (4)**: Check this option to make sure connection strings stick to a deployment slot. This will be helpful when we add additional deployment slots during the next exercises.
   - Select **Apply (5)**.

7. Select **Apply** and **Confirm** for the following Save changes dialog.

8. Switch to the **Overview (1)** Blade, and select **Default domain (2)** to navigate to the Parts Unlimited web site hosted in our Azure App Service using Azure SQL Database.

    ![Overview panel for the App Service is on screen. URL for the app service if highlighted.](media/appmod-ex4-t6-s8.png "App Service public URL")
    
9. Now navigate back to App Service resource and select **partsunlimited-web-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
