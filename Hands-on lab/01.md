# Exercise 1: Review and assess Legacy On-Prem Application

### Estimated Duration: 30 minutes

## Overview

Explore the structure and components of the Parts Unlimited .NET application hosted on a web server and connected to a SQL Server database. Understand the existing architecture to prepare for the migration process.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Review the Legacy On-Prem Application
- Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure App Service

## Task 1: Review the Legacy On-Prem Application

In this task, you will examine the on-premises .NET application hosted on IIS and its SQL Server database to understand its architecture and dependencies.

1. On the Microsoft Edge browser window, enter **localhost** and you will be redirected to the Parts Unlimited web application hosted on the web server.

2. Go through the web application. We will be migrating this web application from on-prem to Azure in further exercises.

3. From the provided VM, Click on **Start (1)** or **Search** button, Search for **RDP (2)** and select the **Remote Desktop Connection (3)** app.

4. Paste the **SQLVM DNS Name** in the **Computer** field and click on **Connect**.

   * **SQLVM DNS Name**: **<inject key="SQLVM DNS Name" style="color:blue" />**

5. Now, enter the SQLVM **Username**, and **Password** provided below and then click on the **Ok** button. Please add the **dot** and **back-slash** “.\” before the Username.

   * **Username**: **<inject key="SQLVM Username"/>** 
   * **Password**: **<inject key="SQLVM Password"/>**

10. Close all the windows and disconnect to the remote session of the SQL VM.

## Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure App Service

Parts Unlimited would like an assessment to see what potential issues they might need to address in moving their application to Azure App Service. You will use the [App Service migration assistant](https://appmigration.microsoft.com/) to assess the application and run various readiness checks.

In this task, you will use the App Service Migration Assistant to assess the web application for compatibility with Azure App Service.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your **WebVM** VM by selecting the **hands-on-lab-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group, and selecting the **WebVM** VM from the list of resources.

    ![The WebVM virtual machine is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/3.1.1.png "WebVM Selection")

2. On the WebVM Virtual Machine's **Overview (1)** Blade, copy the **Public IP address (2)**.

    ![The WebVM VM blade is displayed, Public IP Address copy button is highlighted.](media/updated28.png "WebVM Overview and Public IP")

3. Open a new browser window and navigate to the IP Address you have copied. You may see a different image on the web app while accessing it, as there are multiple images moving on the web app page.

4. Minimize the browser window and open the **AppServiceMigrationAssistant** located on the Desktop.

    ![AppServiceMigrationAssistant is highlighted on the desktop.](media/app-service1.png "App Service Migration Assistant")

5. Once the App Service Migration Assistant discovers the websites available on the server, choose **Default Web Site (1)** for migration and select **Next (2)** to start the assessment.

    ![AppServiceMigrationAssistant is open. Default Web Site is selected. Next button is highlighted.](media/updated29.png "App Service Migration Assistant Web Site selection")

6. Observe the result of the assessment report. In our case, our application has successfully passed 13 tests **(1)** with no additional actions needed. Now that our assessment is complete, select **Next (2)** to proceed with the migration.

   ![Assessment report result is shown. There are 13 success metrics presented. The next button is highlighted.](media/updated30.png "Assessment Report")

   > For the details of the readiness checks, see [App Service Migration Assistant documentation](https://github.com/Azure/App-Service-Migration-Assistant/wiki/Readiness-Checks).
   
1. Minimize the **App Service Migration Assistant** window to keep it running in the background, and proceed with **Exercise 2**: Setting up **Azure Migrate** to streamline the app migration process.
